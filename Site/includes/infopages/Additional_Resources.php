<p>Other resources exist that can help when writing scripts.</p>

<p>Cipscis has a great website with <a href="http://www.cipscis.com/fallout/tutorials/">scripting tutorials</a> on various more advanced topics. He also has a <a href="http://www.cipscis.com/fallout/utilities/validator.aspx">script validator</a> that will work with most of the NVSE functions, though it might not recognize some of the newest things. Make sure you set it to New Vegas mode or it will throw out a bunch of errors.</p>

<p>I've also set up a utility for use with <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> that will add syntax highlighting and even function auto-complete for writing GECK scripts. I try to keep it as up-to-date as possible, so check back periodically for new versions of the files.</p>
